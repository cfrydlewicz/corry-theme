# Corry Theme
WordPress theme for [corryfrydlewicz.com](https://corryfrydlewicz.com/). This theme is an ongoing base for the "next" iteration of my site theme. Once it is completed (if ever), it will be renamed based on the year of its release.

This repo only includes dev files that are either placed in the Theme directory or are used with processors like Grunt to generate those files.

I have [a Design doc on Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14E7WIx-VjmFRg5iJficFHwlCqVtXGtmDRWr3gFGIuDs/edit?usp=sharing) with all kinds of details. It's written for my reference only, so don't expect it to be complete or entirely coherent)


## My Final Theme
Since I've not been able to bring myself to update my site theme in so long, I've decided to stop expecting myself to build fresh themes from scratch every few years with contemporary styles. I'm going to do what I do for work: build a long-term sustainable and maintainable platform.

I'm going to publish it as soon as it's functionally usable, even if all the bells and whistles aren't in yet. It's gotta be better than the latest default WordPress theme at least... _Right?_


### Built for Iteration
I expect this theme will never be finished. I will add to it, break it, and fix it again ad nauseam.


## Mission Statement: This is MY Site
Instead of leaving decisions about how my site works to the user, I'm going to be opinionated while still accessible.

- I am only creating a dark mode version. It's how I prefer to use the digital space.
- No switches for _wireframe mode_ or other gimmicks I've built into my past themes. If you want to see my code, y'all know how to find it.
- My writing style has been evolving, and one of the changes I'm making is removing qualifications. My perspective is the only one I need to platform here.


### Fuck Facebook
This version of my site will not be sharing data with any social media platforms directly. They can send users my way and get nothing in return.
